//Rough feature list, honestly I got too lazy to write this. Just reference I guess.

Core Kernel & Scheduler
Cooperative (non-preemptive) multitasking scheduler.

Fixed maximum of 32 tasks.

Task Control Block (TCB) with support for multiple states (READY, RUNNING, WAITING, SUSPENDED, TERMINATED).

Time-based task sleeping (task_sleep).

Task creation with configurable priority, type, and flags.

Task flags including PROTECTED, CRITICAL, RESPAWN, and ONESHOT.

Automatic respawning of critical tasks upon termination.

Module support with init, tick, and deinit lifecycle callbacks.

Memory Management
Custom dynamic memory manager using a static 180KB heap.

Block-based allocation (kmalloc/kfree) with a maximum of 256 blocks.

Per-task memory ownership and usage tracking (current and peak).

Optional memory limits for application-type tasks.

On-demand memory compaction to reduce fragmentation.

Out-of-Memory (OOM) killer that selectively terminates tasks based on type and priority.

Calculates and reports memory fragmentation percentage.

Task Architecture
Five distinct task types for system hierarchy:

KERNEL

DRIVER

SERVICE

MODULE

APPLICATION

Built-in protection: Only APPLICATION tasks are killable by the OOM killer.

"Root mode" for administrators to override protections and kill any non-kernel task.

Virtual Filesystem (VFS)
In-memory, non-persistent virtual filesystem (data is lost on reboot).

128KB total storage size with 256-byte blocks.

Support for a maximum of 16 files, each up to 16KB in size.

Basic file operations: create, read, write, and delete.

File metadata tracking (name, type, size, timestamps, owner task ID).

Bitmap-based block allocation tracking.

Shell & Commands
Serial-based command-line interface (shell).

System Info: ps, mem, memmap, dmesg, uptime, temp, top, arch.

Task Management: kill, root kill, suspend, resume.

Memory Management: compact.

Filesystem: ls, vfsstat, mkfile, rmfile, cat.

System Control: reboot, clear, root.

Drivers & Monitoring
ILI9341 SPI display driver with a basic graphical status bar.

GPIO driver for up to 9 hardware buttons.

On-chip temperature sensor driver.

System services for monitoring CPU usage and temperature.

System logging (klog) with a 40-entry in-memory circular buffer.

Built-in Software
Applications: Snake game, digital clock, graphical system monitor, memory stress test, CPU burn-in test.

Modules: A simple counter and a system health watchdog.
